# National Parks Analysis Project
## Overview
The objective of this achivement was to select your own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in pyhton and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring.

The material in this project is meant to show off my Python and Tableau work for a travel agency interested in creating travel packages to the US National Parks. 

The travel agency is looking to capitalize on the popularity and attractiveness of US National Parks by trying to create travel packages to mutliple parks. However, what is unknown is what parks should be bundled together and when are the best times to offer these deals. The goal of this work is to offer some insights to help answer these questions and create the best opportunities to maximize sales for our agency.

* Data was obtained from the US National Park Service (www.nps.gov).

## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:
* pandas - for data analysis
* seaborn - for visulaizations
* folium - for geospatial visualizations
* sklearn - for machine learning
* kmeans - for clustering
* quandl - for time-series analysis

## Executing the Code
The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/
